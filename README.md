# Node.js OpenAI API tutorial

I have created a repository demonstrating how to send POST requests to OpenAI's ChatGPT using Node.js and Axios. This was done as part of a live coding session for beginner students at nFactorial Incubator 2023.

The repository serves as a guide for beginners who want to learn how to integrate and interact with the ChatGPT API in their Node.js applications. It showcases how to use the popular Axios library to make HTTP requests and provides examples of sending POST requests to the ChatGPT API endpoint.
